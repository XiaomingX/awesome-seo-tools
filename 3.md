## Rank & Backlink Monitoring

> [!NOTE]
> Building a full open-source alternative to Ahrefs' backlink index is extremely challenging due to the massive infrastructure required to crawl the entire web constantly. Most open-source tools focus on analyzing *your* site (`Screaming Frog`) or managing lists you import (`SEO Panel`), rather than providing a global database of all backlinks on the web.
